                From Chicago grew a business professional who revels in potential, a love for the pursuit of excellence
                and an inspiration towards art and creativity. I am Demetrius Williamson - marketing professional, writer,
                avid traveler & progressive thinker. One-time professional athlete, now a diverse business visionary. A
                creative with history in executing outstanding concepts and ideas of all shapes and sizes within brand
                marketing, business development & project management.
                <br><br>
                You will find at glance my sophistication, diligence and personality to be one favorable for a culturally
                driven environment. Excellence began with an athletic foundation. Native of Chicago, I am the grandson
                of Albert Williamson, a professional Negro League Baseball player. I traveled the world young playing
                organized basketball from the Netherlands to Australia. Playing out my college career at NCAA Division
                I institutions, University of Missouri and Niagara University. Finishing a professional stint in Tianjin,
                China.
                <br><br>
                Beyond the basketball court, my background is marketing driven, emphasizing strategy, branding and
                storytelling. Pushing the culture and telling the most inspiring stories. I worked for nearly a decade at
                Union Pacific, a Fortune 500 company. Spearheading an environment away from tradition into cultural
                relevance. The most recent title I held there was Senior Network Marketing Manager. I’ve also
                collaborated for close to 5 years pro bono with Jordan Brand on marketing strategies and treatments.
                <br><br>
                A brief background of previous positions held:
                Sr. Network Marketing Manager
                Sr. Premium Accounts Manager
                Manager of Territory Operation
                <br><br>
                My native understanding of business is truly from obsessing the work, researching and crafting what
                pushes the needle and explode boundaries. My prowess has a range from professional athlete to
                exceptional performance in business development, relationship building & brand marketing.
                <br><br>
                Sports and athletics remain a cornerstone for who I am. My passion expands within branding, storytelling,
                fashion, photography, music and art. I’m looking to pursue culturally driven projects that merge my
                talents and create the best work of my life! Let’s collaborate!
